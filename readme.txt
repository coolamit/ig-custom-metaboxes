A WordPress plugin to provide an object oriented and clean API for creating custom meta-boxes on wp-admin *post_type* add/edit screens.

== Description ==

**iG:Custom Metaboxes** is a WordPress plugin to provide an object oriented and clean API for creating custom meta-boxes on wp-admin *post_type* add/edit screens.

This plugin is more or less a library which is meant to be used in other plugins or themes. On its own this plugin does nothing, it has no UI nor any configuration to be set/tweaked. This plugin allows addition of HTML5 fields however the functionality of specialized fields like color picker, date picker etc. is browser dependent. The plugin does not add any JavaScript to make these fields compatible with browsers which don't support HTML5 or which don't add functionality to these specialized fields.

This plugin has been written with WordPress.com VIP compliance in mind, so you can use it as is even if you host your website with WordPress.com VIP.

**Requirements**: This plugin requires PHP 5.4 or better and is supported on WordPress 4.0 or better. It might work on a lower version of PHP or WordPress but no support would be provided for those platforms.

Pull requests on Github are welcome.
